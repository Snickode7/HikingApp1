# HikingApp1

My C# project is called the The Hiking Helper app. It was designed to let users keep track of every trail they hike. It consists of a form with multiple catagories, allowing the user to keep a detailed list of every hike they attempt throughout the year. The user should be able to add, edit, and delete trails when required.

To run this app just open it like a normal solution and click run.
